Python 3 Support
================

Ansible 2.2 features a tech preview of Python 3 support. This topic discusses how you can test to make sure your modules and playbooks work with Python 3.


.. note:: Technology preview features provide early access to upcoming product innovations, 
   enabling you to test functionality and provide feedback during the development process.
   Please be aware that tech preview features may not be functionally complete and are not    
   intended for production use. To report a Python 3 bug, please see `Community Information & Contributing <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/community.html#i-d-like-to-report-a-bug>`_.

Testing Python 3 with commands and playbooks
----------------------------------------------------

* `Install Ansible 2.2+ <http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html>`_
* To test Python 3 on the controller, run your ansible command via
  ``python3``. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

    python3 /usr/bin/ansible localhost -m ping
    python3 /usr/bin/ansible-playbook sample-playbook.yml


Testing Python 3 module support
--------------------------------

* Set the ansible_python_interpreter configuration option to
  :command:`/usr/bin/python3`. The ``ansible_python_interpreter`` configuration option is
  usually set per-host as an inventory variable associated with a host or group of hosts:

.. code-block:: ini

    # Example inventory that makes an alias for localhost that uses python3
    [py3-hosts]
    localhost-py3 ansible_host=localhost ansible_connection=local

    [py3-hosts:vars]
    ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

  See the :ref:`inventory documentation <inventory>` for more information.

* Run your command or playbook:

.. code-block:: shell

    ansible localhost-py3 -m ping
    ansible-playbook sample-playbook.yml


Note that you can also use the :option:`-e` command line option to manually
set the python interpreter when you run a command. For example:

.. code-block:: shell

  ansible localhost -m ping -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'
  ansible-playbook sample-playbook.yml -e 'ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3'

What to do if an incompatibility is found
-----------------------------------------

If you find a bug while testing modules with Python3 you can submit a bug
report on `Ansible's GitHub project
<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/>`_.  Be sure to mention Python3 in
the bug report so that the right people look at it.

If you would like to fix the code and submit a pull request on github, you can
refer to :doc:`dev_guide/developing_python3` for information on how we fix
common Python3 compatibility issues in the Ansible codebase.
