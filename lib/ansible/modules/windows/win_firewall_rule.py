            - Replace any existing rule by removing it first.
        default: 'no'
        choices: [ 'no', 'yes' ]
notes:
- The implementation uses C(netsh advfirewall) underneath, a pure-Powershell
  reimplementation would be more powerful.
- Modifying existing firewall rules is not possible, the module does allow
  replacing complete rules based on name, but that works by removing the
  existing rule completely, and recreating it with provided information
  (when using C(force)).
